    "\n",
    "This concept is critical for understanding the econometric specification of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Structural Distinction: Temporal vs. Spatial Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The uniformity arises because the dataset combines variables from two different levels of analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment Variables are National (Temporal): Presidential candidate speeches and party manifestos are \"national public goods.\" When a candidate releases a platform in 2020, that text is identical whether the voter resides in Texas, New York, or California. There is no unique \"Democratic Platform\" specifically tailored for Miami-Dade County.\n",
    "\n",
    "Socio-Economic Variables are Local (Spatial): Unemployment rates or demographics vary from county to county.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technical Implication: During the merging process on the year key, the single national sentiment value (e.g., -0.02) is technically \"broadcast\" to all ~3,000 county observations for that specific year.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Identification Strategy: Longitudinal Variation\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there is no cross-sectional variation in sentiment within a single year (Variance = 0), the model does not compare County A against County B based on sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, the model relies on Longitudinal (Time-Series) Variation. It analyzes how changes in national rhetoric over time correlate with shifts in local voting patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \"In 2016, the national sentiment was positive (+0.05). In 2020, it became negative (-0.02). Did this aggregate shift correlate with a corresponding fluctuation in vote shares?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach measures the impact of a national rhetorical shock on local electoral outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Advanced Econometric Strategy: Interaction Terms\n",

    "To introduce local variation into the sentiment analysis—a powerful econometric technique, we must construct Interaction Terms.\n",
