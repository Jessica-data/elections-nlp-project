A STRONG, RESPECTED AMERICA

Alone among nations, America was born in pursuit of an idea — that a free people with diverse rol
beliefs could govern themselves in peacefFor more than a century, America has spared no effort 1
to defend and promote that idea around the world/And over and over, that effort has been S|
marked by the exercise of American leadership to forge powerful alliances based on mutual
respect with longtime allies and reluctant friendsg with nations already living in the light of \ot
democracy and with peoples struggling to join them.

The might of our alliances, coupled with the strength of our democratic ideals, has been a Lot
driving force in the survival and success of freedom — in two World Wars, in the Korean War, in

the Cold War, in the Gulf War and in Kosovof America led instead of going it alone/ We extended a (07?

DEFEATING TERRORISM fey 107

Today, the Bush Administration is waging a war against a global terrorist movement committed £05
to our destruction with insufficient understanding of our enemy or effort to address the underlying
factors that can give rise to new recruitsf This war isn't just a manhunif We cannot rest until 60S
Osama bin Laden is captured or killed, but that day will mark only a victory in the war on terror, 605
not its end/ Terrorists like al Qaeda and its affiliates are unlike any adversary our nation has ever 695
knownf We face a global terrorist movement of many groups, funded from different sources with Kos
separate agendas, but all committed to assaulting the United States and frée and open societies
around the globe/ Despite his tough talk, President Bush's actions against terrorism have fallen far bas
shortf He still has no comprehensive strategy for victory/ After allowing bin Laden to escape from bas
our grasp at Tora Bora, he diverted crucial resources from the effort to destroy al Qaeda in :
Afghanistanf His doctrine of unilateral preemption has driven away our allies and cost us the 60
support of other nation:

We must put in place a strategy to win ~ an approach that ecognizes and addresses the many ¢-— ae

facets of this mortal challenge, from the terrorists themselves to the root causes that give rise to
new recruits, and uses all the tools at our disposalf Agents of terrorism work in the shadows of £05
more than 60 nations, on every continent/" The only possible path to victory will be found in the {0 jl
company of others, not walking alone/ With John Kerry as Commander-in-Chief, we will never 30g
wait for a green light from abroad when our safety is at stake/ but we must enlist those whose of
support we need for ultimate victory. |

Victory in the war on terror requires a combination of American determination and 107
international cooperation on all fronts/ It requires the ability and willingness to direct immediate, if

the Bush Administration by doubling our counter-narcotics assistance to the Karzai Government 4035

There is no greater threat to American security than the possibility of terrorists armed with §0$

Containing this massive threat requires American leadership of the highest order 7 | leadership 3S

that brings our allies, friends, and partners to greater collaboration and participation f and es
compels problem states to join and comply with international agreements and abandon their 308
weapons programs/ Unfortunately, this Administration's policies have moved America in the See
opposite directionf They have weakened international agreements and efforts to enforce non- 663 SOS :

proliferation instead of strengthening them/ They have not done nearly enough to secure existing 40¢
stockpiles and bomb-making materials/They have failed to take effective steps to stop the North \02

international consensus for early preventive action to lock up and secure existing weapons of mass 10

Locking away existing nuclear weapons and materialf’ The first step is to safeguard all bomb Py 5 é

materials, cooperative security upgrades have not been completed/ The world is relying on 194

ballistic missiles and technology in the past/* The North Koreans have made it clear to the world— !® 5

Winning the peace in Iraq. More than a year ago, President Bush stood on an aircraft carrier 305
under a banner that proclaimed "mission accomplished." But today we know that the mission is
not finished, hostilities have not ended, and our men and women in uniform fight almost alone 20 4
with the target squarely on their backs.

People of good will disagree about whether America should have gone to war in Iraq, but this 2 0 §
much is clear: this Administration badly exaggerated its case, particularly with respect to weapons
of mass destruction and the connection between Saddam's government and al Qaeda, This

Administration did not build a true international coalition, This Administration disdained the $f
United Nations weapons inspection process and rushed to war without exhausting diplomatic 8
alternatives," Ignoring the advice of military leaders, this Administration did not send sufficient aes

forces into Iraq to accomplish the mission. And this Administration went into Iraq without aplan 3o$
to win the peacg, ue

Now this Administration has been forced to change course in order to correct this fundamental xiene
mistake, They are now taking up the suggestions that many Democrats have been making for over 30¢

a year,'And they must — because having gone to war, we cannot afford to fail at peace, We cannot 106

iof,
\O7

allow a failed state in Iraq that inevitably would become a haven for terrorists and a destabilizing
force in the Middle East; And we must secure more help from an international community that
shares a huge stake in helping Iraq become a responsible member of that community, not a
breeding ground for terror and intolerance:'

Asa first step, we must create a stable and secure environment in Iraq; To do this right, we
must truly internationalize both politically and militarily: we cannot depend on a US-only
presence, Other nations have a vital interest in the outcome, and we must bring them in to commit
troops and resources,°The Bush Administration has missed three great opportunities to do that,”
First, the President broke his promise to build a legitimate coalition in Iraq by exhausting |
~~diplomacy before resorting to the use of military forceySecond, when the statue fell in Baghdad,
Kofi Annan invited the United States to come to the table to discuss international support ~ but
we rejected his offer.’ Third, when the President addressed the United Nations last fall, he once
again refused to acknowledge the difficulties we faced in Iraq and failed to elicit support from

other nations,”

The President has not given our troops the clarity of mission, the equipment or the international 3OS

support they need and deserve, We have a different approach based on a simple commitment: J OLE
Troops come firs Our helicopter pilots have flown battlefield missions without the best anti- foce
missile systems,’In a Democratic Administration, that will change. Too many of our nation's finest lole
troops have died in attacks, because tens of thousands were deployed to Iraq without the best joly
bulletproof vests, and there is a shortage of armored vehicles on the ground,‘In a Democratic lod
Administration, that will change. Thousands of National Guardsmen and reservists have been Ou
forced to leave their families and jobs for more than a year ~ with no end in sight ~ because this Oe

Administration ignored the pressing need for a true coalition. 'In a Democratic Administration,
that will change,’ .

To succeed, America must do the hard work of engaging the world’s major political powers in jot
this mission.”We must build a coalition of countries, including the other permanent members of
¥ ;
2004 Democratic National Platform Committee Report — 9

the UN Security Council, to share the political, economic, and military responsibilities of Iraq with lol
the United States.

To win over allies, we must share responsibility with those nations that answer our call, and IO}
treat them with respect. We must lead, but we must listen. The rewards of respect are enormous. nay
We must convince NATO to take on a more significant role and contribute additional military 10
forces, As other countries, including Muslim majority countries, contribute troops, the United 10]
States will be able to reduce its military presence in Iraq, and we intend to do this when Re) c

appropriate so that the military support needed by a sovereign Iraqi government will no longer be
seen as the direct continuation of an American military presence.

Second, we need to create an international High Commissioner to serve as the senior }O7
international representative working with the Iraqi government, This Commissioner should be
backed by a newly broadened security coalition and charged with overseeing elections, assisting jo 7

with drafting a constitution, and coordinating reconstruction; '

, The Commissioner should be highly
regarded by the international community, have the credibility to talk to all the Iraqi people, and

work directly with Iraq's interim. government, the new U.S, Ambassador, and the international \O7
community,’

At the same time, U.S. and international policies must take into consideration the best interests 107
of the Iraqi people, ‘The Iraqi people desperately need financial and technical assistance that is not
swallowed up by bureaucracy and no-bid contracts, but instead goes directly into grassroots [o>
organiza ions#They need to see the tangible benefits of reconstruction: jobs, infrastructure, and
services: They should also receive the full benefits of their own oil production as quickly as 107
possible, so as to rebuild their country and help themselves as individuals, ‘while also reducing the lo7
costs of security and reconstruction on the American taxpayer and the cost of gasoline to LENE
American consumers; ‘And they need to be able to communicate their concerns to international lp
authorities without feeling they are being disrespected in their own country,” o)

America also needs a massive training effort to build Iraqi security forces that can actually ig?
provide security for the Iraqi people, Tt must be done in the field and on the job as well as in the 107
classroom, Units cannot be put on the street without backup from international security forces.” 1O?
This is a task we must do in partnership with other nations, not just on our own:"And this is a task (04
in which we must succeed. ‘If we fail to create viable Iraqi security forces — military and police — i a7

there is no successful exit“for us and other nations.

The challenges in Iraq are great, but the opportunity is also significant Under John Kerry and =] 0&
John Edwards, we will meet those challenges, win the peace in Iraq, and help to create new hope laé
and opportunity for the entire Middle East.’

Africa, US. engagement in Aftica should reflect its vital significance to U.S. interests and the

moral imperative to help a continent struggling with the scourge of HIV/AIDS and under the long io?
shadow of chronic poverty;"The HIV/AIDS pandemic in southern and eastern Africa is a massive [O°7

who takes the responsibility to make the most of it? That bargain is the great source of American
strength, because it unleashes the amazing talent and determination of our people? And as our
people seize the opportunity to build a better life, they build a stronger country /

High-wage jobs are more dependent than ever on high-level skills,/

Now, as never before, education is the key to opportunity, essential to a strong America; So we
believe in an America that offers the best education to all our children — wherever they live,
whatever their background, Period,

We believe in an America where every child comes to school ready to learn? Where every
student is held to high standards, and every school has the resources and responsibility to meet
those standards,Where every classroom has a great teacher, and every student gets enough
personal attention to foster a talent or overcome a difficuity.’We believe in an America where
every teenager completes a rigorous high school curriculum,Where every qualified young person

who wants to go to college can afford it’And where every adult who needs additional job-training.

can get it"

In President George Bush's America, our government ignores the shameful truth that the
quality ofa child's education depends on the wealth of that child's neighborhood Our best public
schools are the best schools in the world, but too many children go to schools that just don't
work," 0 many children who beat the odds and succeed in school can't afford to go on to

his word, providing schools $27 billion less than he had promised, literally leaving millions of .
children. behind.“

A STRONG AMERICAN COMMUNITY

American history is the story of a diverse people striving — sometimes fitfully, but in the end, 6 if
faithfully — to realize our ideals: a common dream of equality, and opportunity, freedom and

commmunity;’Bach step along that path has made us stronger,” 6d

This year we recall two of our country's greatest steps toward equality and inclusion — fifty aa}
years ago, Brown v. Board of Education, and forty years ago, the Civil Rights Act of 1964,/Those 20!
great achievements of the civil rights movement strengthened America immeasurably—by" 201
breaking down the legal barriers to equal citizenship for African-Americans and expanding the
circle of equal opportunity for all.This year, as we celebrate these anniversaries, we récommit to 20!
the spirit of service that secured these breakthroughs and the valnes they embody: all of our
people should have the opportunity to fulfill all of their potential, and each of us should be as
equal in the eyes of the law as we are in the eyes of God;*

That is the America we believe int hat is the America we are fighting for? That is the America 20\
we will build together?’ a

President Bush has a different vision — instead of searching for common ground to bring our BOS
people together, he has sought political advantage in driving our people apartj'He has neglected
ihe opportunity of most Americans, choosing instead to lavish resources on those who need them 205
least #He has rejected the American vision of greater equality, appointing judges more interested 305
in rolling back rights than protecting them:“Perhaps most striking of all, in a time of war, he has gos
abandoned our great tradition of asking Americans to meet shared challenges in a spirit of shared 26

sacrifices This President has regularly governed for the benefit of special interests, not the public
interest:

John Kerry, John Edwards, pnd the Democratic Party believe in a better America, more equal, on
more free — more American: We believe in common service to our commonwealthsAnd we will So i
restore the commitment to ethics in government’

Our commitment to civil rights is ironclad’ We will restore vigorous federal enforcement of our 503
civil rights laws for all our people, from fair housing to equal employment opportunity, from Title =

and to achieve the diversity from which all Americans benefits'We believe a day's work is worth a S03

stronger equal pay laws and stronger enforcement of them/"We, will enact the bipartisan legislation S02

treatment of all service members and believe all patriotic Americans should be allowed to serve SO
our country without discrimination, persecution, or violence;We support the appointment of Ses

judges who will uphold our laws and constitutional rights, not their own narrow agendas;”

Voting is the foundation of democracy, a central act of civic engagement, and an expression of 2072
